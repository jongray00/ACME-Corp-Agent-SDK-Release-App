#### Poor Battery Life
**Symptoms**: Rapid battery drain, shorter usage time, unexpected shutdowns

**Expected Battery Performance**:
- **New Battery**: 8-12 hours typical use, 85%+ health rating
- **1-2 Years**: 6-10 hours typical use, 80-85% health rating
- **2+ Years**: 4-8 hours typical use, below 80% health rating

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. **Battery Health Check**:
   - Use built-in battery health tools
   - Document current capacity vs original
   - Check cycle count and age
2. **Usage Analysis**:
   - Review battery usage by app and system function
   - Identify apps causing excessive drain
   - Check background app refresh and location services
3. **System Assessment**:
   - Test in safe mode to isolate software issues
   - Check for malware or problematic apps
   - Verify optimal system settings

**Resolution**:
